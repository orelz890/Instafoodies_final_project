## 📋 System Overview

The recipe-sharing application is a social media platform for users to share and discover new posts with or without recipes.

Users are able to create and share recipe posts, follow other users, search for recipes, have a weekly recipe plan or a cart list that they can export as a WhatsApp message for their convenience, and receive notifications.

The application also has a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and interaction.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Architectural Design

The application will be developed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which allows for the separation of concerns and easy maintenance of the codebase.

- **Model:** Includes both the communication logic for interacting with the server and the logic for handling data from the server.
- **View:** Android UI, layouts, and user interface elements.
- **ViewModel:** Handles the preparation of data from the Model for the UI and contains UI-related logic.
