### Architectural Design

The application developed using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which allows for the separation of concerns and easy maintenance of the codebase.

- **Model:** Includes both the communication logic for interacting with the server and the logic for handling data from the server.
- **View:** Android UI, layouts, and user interface elements.
- **ViewModel:** Handles the preparation of data from the Model for the UI and contains UI-related logic.

###  Project Management Approach

We embraced Scrum, an agile project management framework, to efficiently manage our project's development. Our daily standup meetings promoted team synchronization, progress sharing, and issue resolution. Guided by a dedicated Scrum Master, we ensured adherence to Scrum principles, rapid obstacle removal, and a culture of continuous improvement.
